# Advent of Code 2022

## Preface

I know I am a little late to the party on this, but I am learning golang and would
really like to get some good practice in it. For that I always jump to some sort of
guided problem statements

## Goal

My end goal is to do the AoC for 2022 before AoC 2023 starts. I would also like
to go back through and refactor at the end to ensure I have the best version for
later referance.
